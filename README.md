# TSG-Bamum-Font
<h2>TSG Bamum is a font supporting the Bamum syllabary of Cameroon.</h2> 

<p1>The Bamum scripts are an evolutionary series of six scripts created for the Bamum language by King Njoya of Cameroon at the turn of the 19th century. They are notable for evolving from a pictographic system to a partially alphabetic syllabic script in the space of 14 years, from 1896 to 1910. Bamum type was cast in 1918, but the script fell into disuse around 1931. A project began around 2007 to revive the Bamum script. This font supports the modern version of the syllabary, not the pictographic version.<br>
<br>
The Bamum script is a left-to-right script containing 80 base characters, two combining diacritics, and six punctuation marks. One of the diacritics, the KOQNDON ꛤ꛰(from kondon), is regularly applied to all of the 80 base characters to extend the syllabic repertoire. The other, the TUKWENTIS ꚧ꛱, is known to be used with only 13 base characters.<br>
